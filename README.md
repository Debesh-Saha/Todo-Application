# Todo-Application
Welcome to my first web project! ðŸŽ‰

I built a simple Todo application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM manipulation). This is part of my journey as I learn web development and coding. ðŸš€
Whatâ€™s Inside
This app allows you to:

1. Add new tasks to your Todo list
2. Edit tasks directly in the list
3. Delete tasks when youâ€™re done with them
4. Mark tasks as completed with a simple checkbox

Features:
1. User-friendly interface: Add, edit, and delete tasks with ease
2. Persistent data: Tasks are saved even if you refresh the page (thanks to local storage!)
3. Simple design: Focus on functionality with clean, minimal styling

Technologies Used
1. HTML: To structure the webpage
2. CSS: To style the page and make it responsive
3. JavaScript: For adding interactivity through DOM manipulation

How to Use
1. Open the project in your browser
2. Enter a task in the input box
3. Click Add to add the task to the list
4. Edit or Delete tasks as needed
5. Mark tasks as completed using the checkbox

This app was a great way for me to dive into web development and gain hands-on experience with DOM manipulation. Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and improving my skills. Let me know what you think!
